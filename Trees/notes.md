Trees are DS that consist of nodes in a parent/child relationship
Trees are nonlinear 
Tree nodes cannot point to other children. Only from parent to child from the root down
Root is the beginning of the tree
Child is a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root
Parent is the converse notion of a child
siblings are a group of nodes with the same parent
Leaf is a node with no children
Edge is the connection between one node and another
