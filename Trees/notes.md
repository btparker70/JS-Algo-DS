Trees are DS that consist of nodes in a parent/child relationship
Trees are nonlinear 
Tree nodes cannot point to other children. Only from parent to child from the root down
Root is the beginning of the tree
Child is a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root
Parent is the converse notion of a child
siblings are a group of nodes with the same parent
Leaf is a node with no children
Edge is the connection between one node and another

Real World Use Cases:
The document object model DOM is a tree
Network Routing
Abstract Syntax Tress
Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning - Minimax tree. decision tree.
Folder directory on computer
JSON

Binary Trees only have 2 children per node
BST are sorted to make it easier to search
BST are used to store data that can be compared
BST nodes store data that are less than the node value to the left, and greater than to the right
Node of 10 has 2 children, 9 and 11
