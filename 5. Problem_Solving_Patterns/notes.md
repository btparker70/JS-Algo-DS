Section 5 notes

steps to improve
  - devise a plan for solving problems
  - master common problem solving patterns

There are common patterns that apply to many types of problems
  - frequency counters
  - multiple pointers
  - slinding window
  - divide and conquer
  - dynamic programming
  - greedy algorithms
  - backtracking

Frequency counters
  - this pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
  - this can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings
  - this pattern is great for problems like:
    - compare 2 strings, arrays or numbers for matching values, etc
