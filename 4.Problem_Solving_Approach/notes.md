When you are stuck trying to figure out a hard problem, what is the approach you can take to get there?

1. Algorithm: A process of set of steps to accomplish a certain task
2. How do you get better at solving algorithms
  - devise a plan for solving problems
  - master common problem solving patterns
3. Problem Solving *****
  - understand the problem
  - explore concrete examples
  - break it down
  - solve/simplify
  - look back and refactor
4. Understand the Problem
  - these are questions to ask:
  - can i restate the problem in my own words?
  - what are the inputs that go into the problem
  - what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
  - can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words do i have enough information to solve the problem?
  - how should i label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
5. Exploring Examples
  - start with simple examples
  - progress to more complex examples
  - explore examples with empty inputs
  - explore examples with invalid inputs
6. Break it down
  - interviewers are looking for people to communicate what they're doing
  - here's the steps im going to take
  - this helps you catch issues before you start writing
7. Simplify
  - find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
  - temporarily ignore that difficulty
  - write a simplified solution
  - incorporate that difficulty back in
8. Look back and refactor
  - going back and refactoring/improving code is the best way to improve
